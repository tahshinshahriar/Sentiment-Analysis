# Sentiment-Analysis

**Description**:
This project implements a sentiment analysis model using machine learning techniques. The model is trained to classify text data into positive or negative sentiment categories. The project includes data preprocessing steps, model selection and training, and evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance.

**Key Features**:
- Data preprocessing: Cleaning text data, converting text to lowercase, removing stopwords, and lemmatizing words.
- Model selection: Using Random Forest Classifier for sentiment analysis.
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to evaluate the model's performance.
- Custom input prediction: Functionality to predict sentiment for custom input text statements.

**Installation**:
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis.git`
- Install required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`


**Dataset**:
The project uses a sentiment analysis dataset available on Kaggle, containing text data labeled with 6 different types of sentiments. The dataset includes separate files for training, testing, and validation.
